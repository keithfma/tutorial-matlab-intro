Teaching materials for my "Introduction to MATLAB" tutorial

This lesson is designed for live tutorials offered at Boston University through
the Research Computing Services group. Feel free to use and modify the material
as you like. I also encourage you to contribute any corrections and improvements
that you may make.

The tutorial is a combination of demonstration and hands-on exercises. The goal
is to get students up and running using and writing MATLAB code. The tutorial is
split into two parts:

  1. Overview of basic syntax and usage
  2. Worked example 

"Pretty" lesson materials are available for the worked example in part 2. These
can be generated by "publishing" the worked_example.m script (written using
MATLAB publishing markup).  

Teaching notes are included for part 1, which are likely not terribly useful to
others. Too bad! The material in part 1 is covered by many other web-based
tutorials, so I do not replicte these efforts with a prettily formatted overview
of my own.
